There are 2 main areas visible in the webpage.

On the left side, there is an area with visible Google Maps, centered to the capital city of Slovakia. In the beginning, there are 4 markers located on the map.

On the right side, there is an area with the list. In the list, you can find 4 Points of Interest. The list is interactive. You can click on the specific item in the list and it will highlight it in the list and center the map to the location of selected POI. You can also use an input area above the list and filter the POIs based on your text when you click on `filter` button. You can restore back the list when you click on the `reset` button. Below the list, you can find the label indicating how many items you have in the list.
